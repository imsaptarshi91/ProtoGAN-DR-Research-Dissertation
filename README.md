Abstract
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a type of progressive microvascular complication of diabetes which can damage blood vessels at the back of the eye and lead to blindness. However early detection can prevent vision loss in 90% of affected individuals. Current prognosis is resource intensive and time taking, but with help of advanced computer vision things are slowly changing and it is becoming easier to detect DR of mild to less severe cases in the early stages(Gulshan et al., 2016; Li et al., 2024). However, due to the black box nature of CNN models - interpretability, plausibility and trust amongst clinicians is still missing. (Deb et al., 2022; Loomba et al., 2023; Sarker et al., 2024)
Traditional DR diagnosis is effective but AI has made a transformative stride in increasing accessibility, improving accuracy and enhancing workflow efficiency. Widespread adoption though still faces obstacles- from implementation cost to clinical validation. As AI powered tools continue to mature, they hold great promise for reshaping DR Screening and personalized care outcomes globally.
Data Scarcity and imbalance of severe cases of DR poses a serious challenge in model training and innovation in this regard. Existing DR grading models either prioritise accuracy without interpretability or provide interpretability but suffer from data scarcity. Although GANs improve data diversity, they lack control at the lesion level, and prototypes have not been used to guide image generation. This proposal seeks to bridge the gap by combining prototype based interpretability with GAN based lesion augmentation and Explainable AI (XAI).(Goodfellow et al., 2014; Yi et al., 2019) The resulting system will generate synthetic images guided by prototypes, thereby augmenting rare classes and improving model transparency.(Guan et al., 2021; Sarker et al., 2024) Finally, Grad-CAM and LIME can further enhance clinical trust as it can assess the model’s basis for decisions and their feature map plausibility can be checked.
