Abstract
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a type of progressive microvascular complication of diabetes which can damage blood vessels at the back of the eye and lead to blindness. However early detection can prevent vision loss in 90% of affected individuals. Current prognosis is resource intensive and time taking, but with help of advanced computer vision things are slowly changing and it is becoming easier to detect DR of mild to less severe cases in the early stages(Gulshan et al., 2016; Li et al., 2024). However, due to the black box nature of CNN models - interpretability, plausibility and trust amongst clinicians is still missing. (Deb et al., 2022; Loomba et al., 2023; Sarker et al., 2024)
